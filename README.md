# SpaceShipRunner

## Overview
**SpaceShipRunner** is my first mobile game created using Unity3D. 

In the game, you control a spaceship gliding down a path filled with obstacles of various shapes and colors. Your mission is to guide the spaceship to collect as many coins as possible while avoiding the obstacles. Any contact with an obstacle will destroy the spaceship, so be careful!

## Goals
Through this project, I aim to learn more about object-oriented programming (OOP), clean coding, and 3D game development. **SpaceShipRunner** features simple yet engaging gameplay that can bring joy to anyone!

## Project Status
This project is a work in progress.
